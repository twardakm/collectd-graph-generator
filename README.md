# collectd-graph-generator

## Overview

Goal of this project is to create as simple as possible tool for viewing data generated by collectd - especially RSS memory used by multiple processes. There exists a [list of front ends for collectd](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/List_of_front-ends) but I was unable to find one fitting all my purposes:

* Presenting RSS memory of multiple processes at one chart
* Presenting data from a server via SSH
* No knowledge of Rrdtool of the user

It's not a very impressive list but I ended up writing long Rrdtool commands, which **I don't want to use every day**.
